        <h1>Samsung ES95</h1>
        <p>the ES95 is a point-and-shoot camera released in ~2013 for the budget camera market. you can find it now for around 30-60â‚¬ used. it shoots 720p/480p/240p@30,15fps video, 4608x3456 (max) jpeg photos. iLauncher is bundled with it, it can be disabled in the menu. (not that it would work in 2024)</p>
        <p>sensor is of CCD type, outputting analog signals, it's got a 16.1MP max photo resolution, lens is 25mm. i have yet to find out how to read firmware from the NAND. aside from that the screen measures 6.8cm and disposing of a singular 3.7V 0.74Ah lithium-ion battery, measuring 40x31x6mm. </p>
