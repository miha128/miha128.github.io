        <h1>motorola moto g84 : a review</h1>
        <p>the moto g84 is a solid midranger for 2024, it's priced competitively at ~245â‚¬ for the things you're getting.</p>
        <p>it's got a 1080x2400 1300nits 405ppi OLED display with a variable refresh rate, modes from 60,90 to 120Hz depending on the mode you select from the display tab in settings.</p>
        <p>for the SoC a Snapdragon 695 (SM6375) is paired with 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB UFS2.2 NAND storage.</p>
        <p>there are two cameras on the back, a main 50MP Samsung ISOCELL GN9 is used while the other one is a 8MP Samsung ISOCELL 4H7, it's also used for macro photo mode. the front camera is a 16MP OmniVision OV16A1Q.</p>
        <p>motorola gives you a case, a 33W charger+a cable. the phone is equipped with a 5000mAh lithium-ion battery and a headphone jack. theoretically there's two stereo speakers, the earpiece is used as a stereo one tho</p>
        <p>connectivity isn't limited, it supports 5G mmWave, Bluetooth 5.2, 5GHz Wi-Fi 802.11ac ,Dual-SIM, a SD card slot that also doubles as a SIM slot (you can't use both tho)</p>
        <p>for the software, it runs stock android with a few moto apps pre-installed. there are different regions with different features, mine shipped with the reteu region. customization with Iconfify and Pixel Xpert is viable by rooting it with Magisk, turning on Zygisk and installing Lsposed.</p>
        <p>in my opinion, i think it's a good phone for the price.</p>
