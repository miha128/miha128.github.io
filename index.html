        <h3>hi! welcome to my site</h3>
        <p>hi! i'm miha and welcome to my website! i don't really write a lot here but here's my <a href="https://miha128.github.io/blog/">blog</a> that's mostly going to have stuff about iot devices and/or just normal computers. beside that i am probably doing various things in my free time</p>
        <p>not that anyone cares but linux has always piqued my interest for as long as i can remember, you can do anything your heart desires if you have superuser access, build software more easily and debug it without having to install non-foss software</p>
        <p>that's it! feel free to check out the links in the window title</p>
